Having fun with GPU acceleration in python.

Benchmarks between the classic way of doing it and GPU can be found in each part.

The project has/will have 3 parts

[PART-1]
	Contains a code that sums 2 vectors using GPU
[/PART-1]


[PART-2]
	Generate first N prime numbers. It uses the basic brute-force algorithm.
	I know there are better algorithms, but the porpuse is to test the GPU. 
[/PART-2]
